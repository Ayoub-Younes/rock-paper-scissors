# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with AI Strategy

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a player can either test AI strategies against each other or play against various AI opponents. The game is designed with a strategic player that can achieve more than a 60% win rate against predefined AI opponents: Mrugesh, Abbey, Quincy, and Kris. The purpose of the project is to develop a winning strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in a classic game environment.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for game logic and AI strategy implementation.
Random: For implementing randomized AI behaviors.
Custom Strategies: Unique strategies developed for AI players like Mrugesh, Abbey, Quincy, and Kris to make the game challenging.
Human Player Interaction: Allows users to input their own moves to play against AI.
